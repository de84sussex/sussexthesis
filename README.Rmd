This project is a fork of Chester Ismayâ€™s
[thesisdown](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown) package. The thesis template is compatible with the requirements of the University of Sussex, and works best when knitting to pdf or gitbook. 

<!--Currently, the PDF and gitbook versions are fully-functional.  The word and epub versions are developmental. 

Formatting can be done using [markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html), and **R** code.-->
