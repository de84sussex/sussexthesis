<!-- You can write in this document like a normal Rmd -->

<!-- You can also use LaTeX -->

<!-- Some tips for using this template are given below, you can delete all of this text after reading -->

<!-- You can reference a figure/table in the text by using \@ref(fig:chunk-label) -->

<!-- You can add ^[footnote text] -->.

<!-- Bibliographies -->

<!-- Of course you will need to cite things, and you will probably accumulate an armful of sources. There are a variety of tools available for creating a bibliography database (stored with the .bib extension). -->

<!-- To cite references in your thesis (after creating your bibliography database), place the reference name inside square brackets and precede it by the "at" symbol.  For example, here's a reference to a book about worrying:  [@Molina1994].  This `Molina1994` entry appears in a file called `thesis.bib` in the `bib` folder.  This bibliography database file was created by a program called BibTeX.  You can call this file something else if you like (look at the YAML header in the main .Rmd file) and, by default, is to placed in the `bib` folder.  

If you look at the YAML header at the top of the main .Rmd file you can see that we can specify the style of the bibliography by referencing the appropriate csl file. The current is APA style but you can download a variety of different style files at <https://www.zotero.org/styles>.  Make sure to download the file into the csl folder.

<!-- More Tips for Bibliographies -->

<!--

- Like with thesis formatting, the sooner you start compiling your bibliography for something as large as thesis, the better. Typing in source after source is mind-numbing enough.

- The citation's label needs to be unique from the other entries.

- When you have more than one author or editor, you need to separate each author's name by the word "and" e.g. `Author = {Noble, Sam and Youngberg, Jessica},`.

- Bibliographies made using BibTeX (whether manually or using a manager) accept LaTeX markup, so you can italicize and add symbols as necessary.

- To force capitalization in an article title or where all lowercase is generally used, bracket the capital letter in curly braces.
