Above is the YAML header that includes a lot of metadata used to produce the document. Be careful with spacing in this header! 

Very few options in the YAML *need* to be changed, such as adding the title, author, date, abstract, acknowledgements, & declaration (for a papers style thesis)

If you'd prefer to not include some sections, such as acknowledgements for example, you can simply delete the section entirely, or you can silence them by adding # before each line. 

For more advanced users, if you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.

<!-- USER GUIDE

The remainder of this document is a user guide for the sussexthesis package, describing how you can get from the files in this R project, to a beautiful, finished thesis! Currently, the .word version has no formatting/templates behind it, and so does not conform to Sussex or APA guidelines, so the .pdf version is the recommended output.


SETUP

You should see in this newly created R project, that you have a number of files & folders. Firstly, there is a _book folder, this folder will eventually contain your knitted finished thesis (more detail on this below). There are also some .Rmd chapters (i.e., 01-chap1.Rmd). You should write each of your chapters within these files, adding/deleting chapters where necessary depending on the structure of your thesis. Notice that each chapter begins with a number corresponding to where it should be placed in the thesis. Ensure when adding/deleting chapters that these numbers are corrected to reflect the order you want your chapters to be presented in. 

There are three additional files which affect the formatting & setup of your thesis: _bookdown.yml, reedthesis.cls & template.tex. Unless you wish to change something major, these files should be left alone. Similarly, the 99-references.Rmd can also be left alone unless you wish to edit the name of your references section, or to add references that are not cited in the main text (more info on referencing below). 

To compile your thesis from multiple chapters into one document, you should knit *this* index.Rmd file. The first time you knit this file, it is likely to take a long time before the output is shown, this is because several LaTeX packages will be installed for the first time (if you dont already have them..) which can be a long-ish process, but it should give you plenty of time to take a tea break (or two) away from your desk :) 

After knitting, depending on your RStudio settings, the resulting file should appear. This is the complete .pdf version of your thesis, containing any chapters you have included, which can be found in the _book folder of your R project. 

To check everything is working OK before you modify anything in this R project, you can knit this file now, continue reading the rest of the guide below, go make some tea, & probably have time to fly around the world twice before the LaTeX install will have finished ready for you to start working on your chapters!


WRITING YOUR CHAPTERS 

Just like in any other .Rmd files you have likely worked with before, you can use markdown and R code chunks within the chapters of your thesis. This makes it nice & easy to analyse data and write up your findings within one document. The chapters are already empty for you to begin writing. 

When using this thesis template, there are some things to be aware of: 

- avoid using duplicate code chunk names in different chapters

- remember to set code chunk display options appropriately (e.g. include = F)

- tables work differently when knitting to a .pdf or .word doc, so be aware of this if switching between the two for proofing purposes

- the different chapter titles in the contents table & in the whole document are generated from the chapter titles written in the chapter .Rmds, make sure the number of #s to denote different heading levels is correct or some extra chapters might appear in your knitted doc

- Most of the formatting of this document is applied automatically, but this may not always be what you want... To add text formatting, you can use *markdown* just like in any normal .Rmd, You can also venture into the template.tex & reedthesis.cls files & edit/add stuff there or you can more easily use LaTeX commands within the .Rmd you are wanting to change (such as using \newpage to create a newpage) I, myself, am not a pro, but a lot can be learned from searching online..


REFERENCING 

To reference sources in this template, the setup is slightly different to what you will have likely used previously. Instead, here we use BibTeX references which we include within a .bib file that we specify in the YAML of our index.Rmd (see the YAML above). There are many pros to using this approach in that you dont ever have to worry again about formatting your in-text citations to APA style, and that your reference list is automatically generated and formatted (amazing right?!)

To add references, you should add BibTeX references to the thesis.bib file contained within the bib folder. These references can usually be easily found on article pages, or with google scholar, and look something like this:


  @article{evans2020internalizing,
    title={Internalizing symptoms and working memory as predictors of mathematical attainment   trajectories across the primary--secondary education transition},
    author={Evans, Danielle and Gaysina, Darya and Field, Andy P},
    journal={Royal Society Open Science},
    volume={7},
    number={5},
    pages={191433},
    year={2020},
    publisher={The Royal Society}
  }


To then cite references in the text of your .Rmd, simply give the label of the reference following the @ i.e.,

  @evans2020internalizing

will cite the reference in your thesis.bib file matching the evans2020internalizing label. The reference will also be included within your bibliography section, automatically formatted in APA style.

One thing I learned when using this method for my own thesis, is that it would have been much better to add these references & to have made sure they were complete (i.e., with no page numbers missing) as I wrote each paragraph/section/chapter, this will save you checking through hundreds of them at the end, & searching for the missing information which might get you temporarily banned from using google like I did :)


Writing a thesis is hard, writing a pretty thesis in R is even harder, but hopefully this sussexthesis package makes that process slightly less painful :)
